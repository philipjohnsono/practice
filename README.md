**Here is how this process works with Bitcoin. When sending Bitcoin, you pay a small fee (in bitcoin) for a network of computers to confirm your transaction is valid. Your transaction is then bundled with other transactions pending in a queue to be added to a new block. The computers (nodes) then work to validate this list of transactions in the block by solving a complex mathematical problem to come up with a hash, which is a 64-digit hexadecimal number. Once solved, the block is added to the network - and your fee, combined with all other transaction fees in that block, is the miner's reward. Each new block added to the network is assigned a unique key (via cryptography). To obtain each new key, the previous block's key and information are inputted into a formula. As new blocks are continually added through the ongoing mining process, they become increasingly secure and harder to tamper with. Anyone caught trying to edit a record will simply be ignored. All future blocks then depend on information from prior blocks - and this dependency from one block to the next forms a secure chain: the blockchain [10]. Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning that while the transaction details are publicly visible on the blockchain, the identities of the parties involved are not directly linked to their Bitcoin addresses. This provides a level of privacy, although transactions can potentially be traced [11].**
